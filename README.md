# microprocessor
This is a microprocessor design project.
In order to run the simulation, open the "microprocessor1.circ" file in the microprocessor1 folder. 
Some codes have been written inside the "operation1" and "operation2" text files. 
These codes are for mathematical operations that the microprocessor can do.
If you want to run any of the codes, right click the "Instruction Memory" (after you have opened the "microprocessor1.circ" file in logism).
Select "load image" from the dialogue that will be displayed.
Now select the text file named either "operation1" or "operation2".
This will load the code in the text file into the Instruction Memory.
Now run the simulation either by clicking the clock one by one or with the simulation tab at the top.
